##### Project was completed for ME314: Theory of Machines - Dynamics.

The purpose of this project was to simulate the dynamics of a swinging whip hitting a falling block using the material taught in the course. This included describing the dynamics of the system using the Euler-Lagrange equations, how impacts can affect the system, and how rotational inertia can change due to impacts.

The video image links below shows the simulation of this system slowed down so impact and changes in the system are seen. All video and coding done for this project was done in Mathematica.
